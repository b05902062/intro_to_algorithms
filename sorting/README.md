# Sorting algorithms.

* To build your program with this library.
    * #include"sorting.h" in your program
    * add sorting.cpp to g++ command line.

         For example, to build exampleMain.cpp with this library.
      
          $g++ exampleMain.cpp sorting.cpp
* The sorting algorithms in this section has the same general format as the qsort in standard c/c++ library that can take in any user-defined data types.

* You can find more helps in exmapleMain.cpp and header files to see definitions and how to use these sorting algorithms.

* Algorithms included:
    * bubbleSort
    * insertionSort
    * mergeSort
