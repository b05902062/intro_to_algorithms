# Sorting algorithms.

* To build your program with this library.
    * include sorting.h in your program
    * add sorting.cpp to g++ command line.

         For example, to build exampleMain.cpp with this library.
      
          $g++ exampleMain.cpp sorting.cpp
* The sorting algorithms in this section has the same usage as the qsort in standard c/c++ library.

* You can find more helps in exmapleMain.cpp to see how to use these sorting algorithms.

* Algorithms included:
    * bubbleSort
    * insertionSort
    * mergeSort
