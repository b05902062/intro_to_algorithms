# Subarray algorithms.

* To build your program with this library.
    * #include"subarray.h" in your program
    * add subarray.cpp to g++ command line.

         For example, to build exampleMain.cpp with this library.
      
          $g++ exampleMainBuildInInt.cpp subarray.cpp
* The subarray algorithms in this section has a general format that can defined as desired by users.

* You can find more helps in exmaple files to see how to use these sorting algorithms.

* Algorithms included:
    * optimalSubarray (maximum subarray)
